/* Foursquare is a mobile application for "checking in" to places people 
/* have visited. This program collects data about where people have
/* "checked in" using Foursquare's API (Application Program Interface).
/* The "check in" data is stored in a CheckIn object, along with the date,
/* time, and name of the place the check in came from. 
/* 
/* In this project, we continuously collected check in data from Foursquare
/* for a list of pre-defined places. The data, or "CheckIn" objects are stored
/* in a LinkedList of CheckIns which all share the same time from which they were
/* collected. This LinkedList is then put into a HashMap of LinkedLists of CheckIns,
/* where each LinkedList's key is the date and time it was collected. The HashMap is
/* stored into a file using Serializable.
/* 
/* Using this data we have collected each hour of each day, we can figure out things
/* such as what the most popular place is given any day, what places are "declining"
/* (least popular), what place has the most fluctuation of checkins, etc.
